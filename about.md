Hi, I'm Fran Iglesias

I write PHP code focusing on quality. I follow SOLID principles and use TDD and Design Patterns. But I also write pretty good HMTL/CSS and acceptable Javascript (work in progress).

Currently working and learning at [Atrapalo](http://atrapalo.com) as Developer in the Flights Team at Barcelona.
