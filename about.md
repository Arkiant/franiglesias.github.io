Hi, I'm Fran Iglesias

I write PHP code focusing on quality. I follow SOLID principles and use TDD and Design Patterns. But I also write pretty good HMTL/CSS and acceptable Javascript (work in progress).

Currently working and learning at [Holaluz](http://holaluz.com) as Backend Developer of the Internal Tools Team at Barcelona.

Formerly I worked at [Atrapalo](http://atrapalo,com)
